# [Noogle](https://hsjobeki.github.io/noogle/)

Noogle is a Nix API search engine. It allows you to search functions based on their types and other attributes in `nix` projects. In `nixpkgs` especially the `builtins` and `lib` attributes.

- Beginners-friendly search for nix and nix-related functions
- Expert search with directly typing type signatures
- Search functions based on:
  - type 
  - signature
  - name
- tree-search from one type to another
 
## How it works

The idea is to use a fork of `nixdoc`to generate json data from all functions. That have the `Type` field which is currently supported from nixdoc.

View the prototype [here](https://hsjobeki.github.io/noogle/)

## We need your help / what is missing

- Parsing `Types:` into a real type signature tree
- Upstream missing type informations (like in /lib/attrsets.nix)
- Write type signatures for the `builtins` in json
- Add path, where each function can be imported from. e.g. `lib.makeOverridable` or `lib.customisation.makeOverridable` (it is available in both sets)
- Website
    - Make sure functions with missing type signatures can be found too
    - Add filter by tags e.g. lib.lists
    - Mobile optimization for reading on the go
- Clean up / enhance my nixdoc fork. 
    - Make the `sloppy` parser more error resistant
    - Some valueable information can be used from the rnix AST ?
